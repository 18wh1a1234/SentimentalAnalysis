But this time it felt different. It felt lonelier and smaller.

Why? I thought for a long time.

I thought, maybe because it became harder to imagine.

I was frustrated and depressed,

but I took notes, wrote songs, and thought about who I was.

I thought,

“If I give up here, then I’m not the star of my life.”

“This is what an awesome person would do.”
